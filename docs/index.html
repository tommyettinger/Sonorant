<h2>
    Choose Your Implementation:
</h2>
<ul>
    <li><a href="tea-js/index.html" target="_blank">TeaVM, JavaScript</a> (should work everywhere; preferred)</li>
    <li><a href="tea/index.html" target="_blank">TeaVM, WASM</a> (won't always work on mobile browsers)</li>
    <li><a href="gwt/index.html" target="_blank">Google Web Toolkit</a> (should work everywhere)</li>
</ul>
<h2>
  Controls for all implementations:
</h2>
<ul>
    <li>'h' decreases the hue rotation (with Shift, it increases the rotation). This can be held down, and wraps.</li>
    <li>'g' decreases the 'g' parameter that affects color (with Shift, it increases 'g'). This can be held down. If this stops doing anything, it has hit its lower or upper limit; try it again with or without holding shift.</li>
    <li>'b' decreases the 'b' parameter that affects color (with Shift, it increases 'b'). This can be held down. If this stops doing anything, it has hit its lower or upper limit; try it again with or without holding shift.</li>
    <li>'t' decreases the twistiness (with Shift, it increases twistiness). This can be held down. If this stops doing anything, it has hit its lower or upper limit; try it again with or without holding shift.</li>
    <li>'d' decreases the number of divisions, or raises it if shift is held.</li>
    <li>'s' moves the seed down by 1/1024, or up by 1/1024 if shift is held.</li>
    <li>'/' moves the seed down by 1/200, or up by 1/200 if shift is held.</li>
    <li>'1' forces the seed to 1, regardless of its prior value.</li>
    <li>'a' changes the shader between one of two alternate styles.</li>
    <li>'o' starts the animation over, from its initial form (at time 0).</li>
    <li>'f' prints the current frames per second (higher means better performance) to the log.</li>
    <li>'c' writes to the clipboard and reloads the page with the address set to load the current state.</li>
    <li>On desktop only, Alt-Enter or Alt-F11 will toggle fullscreen mode.</li>
    <li>On desktop only, 'Q' or 'Escape' will quit.</li>
</ul>
